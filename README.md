<b>GOA CUSTOM PRODUCT DETAILS PLUGIN</b>

It's a plugin for one of my customer. It's still not ready yet.

<b>Specs:</b>

Adds custom text and image to your WooCommerce product detail page.

<b>In the future I'm planning to make these changes:</b>

More admin page abilities for a better control for your needs.
Like more options than just a check box, like radio buttons, list etc.
Option to select where you want to display these custom things in WooCommerce product page through hooks.
CSS adjustments.

<b>Install:</b>

Simply put in /plugins directory and unzip.
Requires WooCommerce.

If you have other suggestions please let me know.

Thank you, Ali Ozgenc
